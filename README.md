# Flowise-Zep-Configuration-Setup
configuring the ZEP memory when using Flowise and OpenRouter, we need to understand the problem in more detail. From your description, it seems that the ZEP memory works when using the original OpenAI setup, but it fails when you switch to OpenRouter.
Steps to Debug and Fix the Issue

    Check ZEP Memory Configuration:
        ZEP (Zero-shot Endpoint Memory) allows an AI model to retain conversation context across requests.
        When switching from OpenAI to OpenRouter, ensure that the memory configuration is correctly set up and compatible with OpenRouter. Flowise and OpenRouter may require specific configurations for memory handling that differ from OpenAIâ€™s default setup.

    Check OpenRouter Configuration:
        OpenRouter is often used for proxying requests between different AI models or handling memory differently than OpenAI. If it works with OpenAI but not with OpenRouter, the issue may lie in how the OpenRouter API is structured or the memory management with OpenRouter.
        Ensure that OpenRouter is correctly routing the requests to the correct endpoint and that the memory handling setup is configured according to OpenRouter's standards.

Possible Solutions and Fixes

    Check if OpenRouter supports Memory (ZEP): OpenRouter may not support ZEP memory out-of-the-box, as OpenRouter can be built to work with several different model APIs and each might have its own memory management system. Verify if OpenRouter supports the exact version of memory handling that ZEP uses in Flowise. If OpenRouter does not support ZEP, you may need to modify how memory is handled in the pipeline.

    Ensure Memory API Integration: ZEP memory in OpenAI might be working because OpenAI has specific memory APIs that Flowise supports. OpenRouter might require manual setup for integrating memory (such as storing context between requests, passing tokens to preserve context, or managing session data).

    Check the OpenRouter documentation to see how it handles session or memory, and ensure the configuration in Flowise matches that setup.

    Enable Memory in Flowise for OpenRouter: If Flowise is not recognizing the memory for OpenRouter, you may need to update its settings for the OpenRouter integration. This could involve:
        Flowise Memory Settings: Make sure memory is enabled in the Flowise settings.
        OpenRouter Memory Parameters: Ensure that the memory configuration (e.g., passing context or tokens) is explicitly defined in the Flowise configuration for OpenRouter. This may include adjusting parameters such as session_id or context_id.

    Debugging the API Response: When Flowise uses OpenRouter and ZEP memory is not working, look at the response from OpenRouter. Sometimes the lack of memory may result from misformatted requests or missing parameters.
        Check Logs: Enable logging on Flowise and OpenRouter to view any errors or warnings related to memory.
        Check Responses: Review the responses from OpenRouter to ensure the memory context (if passed) is being returned correctly. If OpenRouter is not passing the context back, it may require additional configuration to manage context or memory.

Example Configuration for OpenRouter with Memory:

Here is an example of what you might need to configure in Flowise to set up memory for OpenRouter:

{
  "type": "OpenRouter",
  "config": {
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "api_key": "your_openrouter_api_key",
    "memory": {
      "enabled": true,
      "max_tokens": 4000,
      "store_id": "unique_session_id",
      "context": "Use this field to pass conversation history",
      "options": {
        "type": "zep_memory"
      }
    }
  }
}

Additional Considerations:

    Token Limitation: If OpenRouter or ZEP has specific token limitations, ensure that you are passing the correct number of tokens (not too many or too few).
    Session Management: You may need to manually handle session data (e.g., store previous context or conversation history) to ensure continuity in responses.
    Compatibility Issues: If Flowise has native OpenAI memory configurations but no equivalent for OpenRouter, you may need to manually integrate memory handling or wait for an update in Flowise or OpenRouter that better supports memory.

Next Steps:

    Review the documentation for OpenRouter to ensure that it is compatible with the memory setup you are using in Flowise.
    Look into Flowise's memory management settings, and ensure they are compatible with OpenRouter's API configuration.
    Test by simplifying the setup: Start with basic configurations and gradually add complexity (e.g., enable memory for a smaller scope and check results).

If the issue persists after these checks, consider reaching out to the support teams for both Flowise and OpenRouter for more detailed configuration advice specific to memory handling with OpenRouter.
